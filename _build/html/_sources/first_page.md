Introduction
============================
----------

**What is this?** This is a curated list of python snippets for busy and equally lazy Data Scientists ðŸ˜„

**What does this include?** Starting with a basic introduction we move on to ways to create and query a KG. Then we discuss KG embeddings techniques. Finally, we look at the AI practices in KG by discussing the latest applications and generic researchÂ tracks.

**Why this?** Recently, there has been a lot of hype around this subject which has brought interest from academics and industry equally. I found that irrespective of the field there is a need of an introductory notes which while covering the basics doesn't shy away from the details and complexity. This book is an attempt to consolidate wide range of ideas related to KG under one shed.

**How to read?** I have divided the complete article into multiple sections. Being a transcription of a lecture, it is intended to be read in order. That said, each section is sufficiently independent, so feel free to skip through the topics you are already familiar with.

**Alternatives?** If you are more of a video person, I will suggest having a look at the two-part lecture videosâ€Š-â€Š[part 1](https://panopto.ut.ee/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=edd60709-c357-45e6-b22d-ad0701355d11) and [part 2](https://panopto.ut.ee/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=71f2092a-f035-4940-a33f-ad0e013d0ef2). Otherwise, if you prefer written forms, tag along ðŸ˜ƒ
