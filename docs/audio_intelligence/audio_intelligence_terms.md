- Here are some of the most widely used terms in Audio Intelligence.

## Sample Rate, Bit Depth and Bit Rate

- **Sample rate** is the number of audio samples recorded per unit of time. For example, an audio with 16kHz sample rate, means that for one second, we have captured 16000 samples. 
- **Bit Depth** measures how precisely the samples were encoded. Here for a 16kHz sample rate audio, if the bit depth is 8 bits, it means we are using 8 bits of data to store each 16k samples per second.  
- **Bit rate** is the amount of bits that are recorded per unit of time. For the above example, it means we have `16k * 8 bits` of data per second i.e. `128kbps`
