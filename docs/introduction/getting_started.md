### Introduction

- Did you recently decide to become a Data Scientist? But you don't know what to do next? How can you get started? Well it's common to be confused about how to begin your journey in this amazing world of Data Science :robot:
- Just like learning any other technique, it's better to approach learning Data Science from scratch and in multiple phases. Remember, this is by no means a comprehensive guide to make you a Data Science expert. The intention of this guide is to provide the essential knowledge and skills to get you started in the Data Science field.
- One more thing, the field of Data Science is quite vast. The learning approach could vary based on what you want to become -- Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Research Scientist, ML Engineer, etc. In this guide, we will take a more generic approach and focus on the most essential skills and knowledge you can utilise no matter what you want to become.
- But before we get started, let's have a look at the different desginations in the Data Science field and what they are all about.
  - **Data Engineer:** Data Engineer handles data i.e. they are responsible for the data processing and data analysis.
  - **Data Scientist:** Data Scientist handles model training i.e. they are responsible to leverage the data to generate predictive and actionable models.
  - **ML Engineer:** ML Engineer deploys models i.e. they are responsible to take the model and perform accessible and scalable deployment.

!!! Note
    **Research Scientist** is another Data Science related designation which is usually more research and academics related, when compared to **Data Scientist**, which is more practical and industry related.

- Now, let's get started by dividing the hurcuelean task of masting Data Science into three levels, namely L1, L2 and L3. L1 is the most basic level, and L3 is the most advanced level. And advancing each level could takes a minimum of 2 months. 
- To learn is to read, understand and apply. With this in mind, each level is further divided into two subtasks of theory and practice. The idea is to have atleast one action item for each subtasks in each level. More details are, 


|   Levels           | Theory                | Practice     |
|--------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| L1     | Online Courses        | Projects     |
| L2 | Domain Specialization | Competitions |
| L3       | Research Papers       | Frameworks   |

### L1: the absolute beginners ðŸ‘¦ 

- *TODO*

### L2: the intermediate level ðŸ‘¨ 

- *TODO*

### L3: the to be experts :sunglasses:

- *TODO*
