### Introduction

- Did you recently decide to become a Data Scientist? But you don't know what to do next? How can you get started? -- Well it's common to be confused about how to begin your journey in this amazing world of Data Science :robot: ðŸŒŽ 
- Just like learning any other technique, it's better to approach learning Data Science from scratch and in multiple phases. Remember, this is by no means a comprehensive guide to make you a Data Science expert overnight - we don't provide any certifications ðŸ“„ :wink:. The intention of this guide is to provide the essential knowledge and skills to get you started in the Data Science field. And most importantly, to help you plan your journey in the right direction.
- One more thing, the field of Data Science is quite vast. The learning approach could vary based on what you want to become -- Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Research Scientist, ML Engineer, etc. In this guide, we will take a more generic approach and focus on the most essential skills and knowledge you can utilise no matter what you want to become.
- But before we get started, let's have a look at the different desginations in the Data Science field and what they are all about.
  - **Data Engineer:** Data Engineer handles data i.e. they are responsible for the data processing and data analysis.
  - **Data Scientist:** Data Scientist handles model training i.e. they are responsible to leverage the data to generate predictive and actionable models.
  - **ML Engineer:** ML Engineer deploys models i.e. they are responsible to take the model and perform accessible and scalable deployment.

!!! Note
    **Research Scientist** is another Data Science related designation which is usually more research and academics oriented, when compared to **Data Scientist**, which is more practical and industry oriented.

- Now, let's get started by dividing the hurculean task of masting Data Science into three levels, namely L1, L2 and L3. L1 is the most basic level, and L3 is the most advanced level. 
  
!!! Note
    Advancing from one level to another is subject to your own understanding and progress. There is no time related or checkpoint related explicit grading system that I will recommend. I believe, if it seems you are not learning anything new by following the steps of a certain level, you are qualified to move on to the next level.

- *"To learn is to read, understand and apply."* -- with this in mind, each level is further divided into two subtasks of **theory** and **practice**. The idea is to have atleast one action item for each subtasks in each level. More details are below, 


|   Levels           | Theory                | Practice     |
|--------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| L1     | Beginner Online Courses        | Course Assignments and Code replication  |
| L2 | Domain Specialization Courses | Projects and Competitions |
| L3       | Research Papers and Books       | Publish Frameworks   |

### L1: the absolute beginners ðŸ‘¦ 

- This is the starting point of our journey. Here we want to get the basic understanding of the Data Science field and start getting our hands dirty with the basics. Let's us try to go through the individual substasks in details.
- **Theory:** We will limit our scope to going through online courses that provides high level understanding. Here is a list of some free online course or materials for you to go through.
  - [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) and [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3.8/)
  - [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
  - [Intro to Deep Learning by MIT](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)
  - [Data Engineering Foundations Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-engineering-foundations)
- **Practice:** it can start with any assignments mentioned in the theory courses or materials. On top of it, we can also perform code Replication i.e. to look into basic code snippets and try to replicate them. Pick any existing EDA script or ML code or any other code snippet and try to replicate on your own. This provides the opportunity to perform guided practice as you can always refer back the original code if you are stuck!
### L2: the intermediate level ðŸ‘¨ 

- Now we have moved on to the intermediate level. Data Science in itself is a very vast field and includes multiple sub-domain like NLP, CV, RL, etc. By now, you should have some inclination towards one or more of these fields. It's time to get some domain specific specializations. Let's us go through the individual subtasks in details.
- **Theory:**  Based on different fields and generic topics, here is a list of introductory materials that you can refer,
  - [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)
  - [CS224U: Natural Language Understanding](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/)
  - [CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
  - [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver](https://www.deepmind.com/learning-resources/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-with-david-silver)
  - [Full Stack Deeplearning](https://fall2019.fullstackdeeplearning.com/)
  - [Awesome MLOps Github](https://github.com/visenger/awesome-mlops)
- **Practice:** in terms of practices, code assignment is mandatory and hence not repeated here. But another advice is to participate in competitions and hackathons like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). The plan coule be to first participate in old competions and get a feel of coding and developing under pressure. And then to participate in live competitions and compete with the some of the best Data Science enthusiasts out there! Another thing that you can do is to create a simple AI/ML project from scratch, this will give you a much needed industrial experience. Here is an [article](https://medium.com/itnext/convert-your-ai-ideas-into-working-demos-on-hugging-face-spaces-2ba080482a16) I wrote on how to ideate and publish your projects. You can also refer this [Github repo](https://github.com/ashishpatel26/500-AI-Machine-learning-Deep-learning-Computer-vision-NLP-Projects-with-code) to get some insiprations or AI project ideas.

!!! Note
    Please be aware that the intention of particitation should be to learn. If you enter any competition without proper preparation and practice, you might not be able to get the best results. But that should never demotivate you. Your intention should be to learn, if it's that, I am sure you will come out of any competition with learning something new. Wining or Lossing is just the by product. :peace:
### L3: the to be experts ðŸ˜Ž

- We have reached the final (and an never ending) level :wink:
