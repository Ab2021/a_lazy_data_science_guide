        What is the different between Standardization and Normalization?

    === "Answer"

        Normalization is the process of scaling the data to a common scale. It is also known as Min-Max Scaling where the final range could be [0, 1] or [-1,1] or something else. $X_{new} = (X - X_{min})/(X_{max} - X_{min})$ Standardization is the process of scaling the data to have zero mean and unit variance. $X_{new} = (X - mean)/Std$
