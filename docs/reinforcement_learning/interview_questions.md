!!! Question ""
    === "Question"
        #### What is the difference between model-free and model-based RL?

    === "Answer"

        Model-based RL has an agent that tries to understand *(or model)* the world by learning state transition function and reward function. So if an agent can predict the next state and the reward before taking the action, it is a model-based RL algorithm. If not then it is model-free algorithm. Refer this [AI StackExchange QA](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/4456/whats-the-difference-between-model-free-and-model-based-reinforcement-learning)

!!! Question ""
    === "Question"
        #### What is the difference between policy-based vs value-based RL?

    === "Answer"

        Policy based RL agents tries to directly learn the best policy for a given state, whereas value based RL agents learns the value function *(estimated reward for each action in a state)* and then select action based on their strategy.
